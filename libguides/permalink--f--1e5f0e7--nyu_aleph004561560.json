        "description" : [ "\"Any research study needs a solid design before data collection or analysis can begin. This design ensures that any experimental evidence obtained by a researcher serves its purpose in making the researcher's argument more robust. Just as an architect prepares a blueprint before he approves a construction project, a researcher needs to prepare a plan their own before they start their research. The Palgrave Handbook of Research Design in Business and Management uses a new state-of-the-art research design typology model to guide researchers in creating the blueprints for their experiments. By focusing on theory and cutting-edge empirical best-practices, this handbook utilizes visual techniques to appease all learning styles.\"-- Provided by publisher", "\"This is a scholarly double-blind peer-reviewed edited book. Quality was designed-in through the team selection and review processes. Over 40 experienced practitioner-scholars and subject matter experts were selected from accredited universities and respected organizations around the world. For example, our foreword author Dr. Joseph F. Hair Jr. is a well-known research methods textbook author. A new state-of-the-art research design typology model was developed to guide authors and readers. The authors used visual techniques - tables and diagrams - to appease all learning styles and especially English Second Language Learners. Additionally, the authors integrated and applied authentic examples into their chapters based on their experience or a published scholarly study. A visual chapter map in each chapter shows where the design theory is positioned on the research ideology continuum and which research design typology components are addressed.
