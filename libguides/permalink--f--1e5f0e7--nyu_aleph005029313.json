Whether you plan to go to graduate school or to enter the world of work, a decent GPA is not enough to make you stand out. So, how can you gain a competitive edge? Like a trusted advisor, this book steers you to the experiences outside the classroom that will help you build your professional portfolio and show prospective employers and graduate school programs that you have the skills they want -- researching, writing, public speaking, and statistical reasoning. Since professional research experience remains the most important avenue for fostering and demonstrating these skills, the authors emphasize ways to get involved in scholarly research, including finding research opportunities, conducting the research, going to scholarly conferences, and presenting findings in papers and talks. ...
