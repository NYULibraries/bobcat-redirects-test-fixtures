        "description" : [ "This book is a practical guide to the appointment, promotion, and tenure (APT) process for clinical faculty members employed by medical schools. The number of clinical faculty members in US medical schools has increased exponentially in the last two decades. At the same time, faculty career tracks and promotion requirements have changed dramatically and medical schools have introduced multiple non-tenure career tracks. Currently, only about 25% of the approximately 150,000 members of clinical departments. This book provides insights and recommendations on career planning and academic promotion for clinical faculty members. It also addresses much of the \"mythology\" surrounding the APT process and demonstrates how academic promotion should be used as a career-building process rather than a daunting high-risk event. Topics include concepts and processes within academic promotion; navigating the academic promotion and tenure process; and managing the outcome of the APT application. Academic Promotion for Clinicians is a valuable resource for clinical medicine faculty members as they engage in and successfully handle the challenges in the APT process and thus realize their career goals." ],
