They exit MBA programs with major firms in mind then often find the corporate grind uninspiring.

Steve Kahan will be the first to tell you he knew nothing about tech when he first went to work at a tech start-up many years ago.

In the 30+ years he's spent in the tech start-up world he's worked for seven of them, and the first six have either successfully sold or have gone public, generating over $2.5 billion in shareholder value.
