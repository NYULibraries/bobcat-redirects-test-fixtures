        "description" : [ "\"This book provides an overview of various application spheres and supports further innovations needed in information management and in the processes of knowledge generation. The professions, organizations and scientific associations involved are unusually challenged by the complexity of the data situation. Cartography has always been the central field of application for georeferencing digital cultural heritage (DCH) objects. It is particularly important in enabling spatial relation analysis between any number of DCH objects or of their granular details. In addition to the pure geometric aspects, the cognitive relations that lead to knowledge representation and derivation of innovative use processes are also of increasing importance. Further, there is a societal demand for spatial reference and analytics (e.g. the extensive use of cognitive concepts of \"map\" and \"atlas\" for a variety of social topics in the media). There is a huge geometrical-logical-cognitive potential for complex, multimedia, digital-cultural-heritage databases and stakeholders expect handling, transmission and processing operations with guaranteed long-term availability for all other stakeholders. In the future, whole areas of digital multimedia databases will need to be processed to further our understanding of historical and cultural contexts. This is an important concern for the information society and presents significant challenges for cartography in all these domains. This book collects innovative technical and scientific work on the entire process of object digitization, including detail extraction, archiving and interoperability of multimedia DCH data.\"-- Provided by publisher" ],
