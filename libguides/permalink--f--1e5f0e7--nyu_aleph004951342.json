        "description" : [ "\"Students and professionals across a variety of disciplines need to write public policy in a manner that inspires action and genuine change. You may have amazing ideas about how to improve the world, but if you aren't able to communicate these ideas well, they simply won't become reality. In Public Policy Writing That Matters, communications specialist David Chrisinger argues that public policy writing is most persuasive when it tells clear, concrete stories about people doing things. Combining helpful hints and cautionary tales with writing exercises and excerpts from sample policy documents, Chrisinger teaches readers to craft concise, story-driven pieces that exceed the stylistic requirements and limitations of traditional policy writing. Too often, public policy writing is convoluted, opaque, and exclusive. Chrisinger, who teaches introductory policy writing courses around the country, offers a step-by-step guide for anyone interested in planning, organizing, developing, writing, and revising accessible public policy. From the most effective use of data visualization, the best way to write a sentence, and the ideal moment to add a compelling anecdote to advice on using facts to strengthen an argument, this little book, inspired by Strunk & White's classic style guide, will allow anyone crafting public policy to make a bigger impact. Aimed at helping students and professionals overcome their default impulses to merely \"explain,\" this book reveals proven, classroom-tested tips for writing sophisticated policy that is also easy to understand. This practical, concise handbook will not only aid students throughout graduate school, but will also remain a reference to consult throughout their professional careers. A vital tool for any policy writer or analyst, Public Policy Writing That Matters is a book for everyone passionate about using writing to effect real and lasting change\"-- Provided by publisher.", "\"In a variety of disciplines, students and professionals need to be able to write public policy in a manner that inspires action and change. David Chrisinger, who teaches introduction to policy writing and research design to graduate students at the Bloomberg School, and around the country, offers a step-by-step guide to actually plan, organize, develop, write, and revise public policy. Public Policy Writing That Matters will help students and professionals overcome the default writing style to merely \"explain\" and teach them to write an effective piece of policy that includes complex data, clear messages, and, most importantly, has a significant impact. A nice blend of real examples from public health, education, social sciences, and environmental studies, including both good and bad writing, make the author's hands-on approach inviting and enjoyable for students and professionals. This practical, concise guide will not only aid students throughout graduate school but will also remain a reference they consult as they move through their professional careers in government, education, public health, public affairs, management, and social work. Since beginning this project, Chrisinger has also become a go-to consultant for congressional staffers and instructor of policy writing around the country. His successful approach to teaching is captured in this book\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
