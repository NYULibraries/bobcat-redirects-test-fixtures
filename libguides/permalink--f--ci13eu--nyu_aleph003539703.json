TRIS Online is published as a collaborative effort by the Transportation Research Board, the National Transportation Library, and Research and Innovative Technology Administration. The TRIS Online database contains over half a million records of published transportation research including technical reports, books, conference proceedings and journal articles. Currently there are almost 24,000 TRIS records with links to electronic copies of the full-text. The time span covers literature from the 1960s to the present, with some coverage of prior years. Highway Research Board publications are covered back to 1923. TRIS coverage includes the disciplines of planning, finance, design and construction, materials, environmental issues, safety and human factors and operations for the modes of highways, transit, railroads, maritime and aviation. TRIS Online includes material indexed and abstracted by TRB as well as the material entered by the Transportation Libraries at the University of California at Berkeley and Northwestern University. Includes a new search interface with the ability to search TRIS Online, Transportation Research Thesaurus, and the NTL Digital Collection simultaneously." ],
