CONFIDENTIAL My dear McFadyean, As I have written several letters to Urwick to-day I am directing this one to you. Thanks for your last letter; I hope that Georgi will be able to do all you want. From the figures we have of the deliveries during the first three the Germans have completed the deliv- ery of the 6,000,000 tons of coal. About a month ago I had a very serious talk with one of the boss men in the Reichskohlenkommissar's Office and pointed out to him that if the delivery of coal to the Entente at the end of October failed by 5000 tons, then it would be considered that the Germans had failed to carry out their agreement. I spoke to him quite frankly and pointed out the seriousness of this affair and said that I personally was most anxious to see the Germans fulfil their obligations up to date. We discussed the question of transport both by rail and river and I pointed out that if a serious accident took place on the Montzen Viaduct during the latter part of October, it would tend to throw out of gear the smooth- working of the full end empty coal trains. Montzen lies in Belgian territory and is just across the frontier not for from Aix-la-chapelle. Accidents on railways are caused human negligence or the failure of material or, in some cases, they are caused through the connivance of some person. I know Montzen Station and the Viaduct very well as I have visited this section of the railwa more than once. The line between Air-la-Chapelle, Montzen and Vise was one of the great German railway war constructions and is an exceedingly fine piece of engineering. I had already discussed the question of a serious accident on this section of the line with Lieut. Colonel Fohann### of the Essen Coal Bureau, and we had discussed the solution by making use of the railway connection line further North between Germany and Belgium which traverses a small portion of Holland. After my talk with the Germans I understand that Dr. Stutz, the Reichskohlenkommissar was himself approached on the matter and it was decided to complete the programme by the 27th October at the latest. There was the difficulty of getting trucks - this was got over by ordering up a large sup- ply from the central German Brown Coal District - Halle. This, of course, upset the commercial requirements of a large part of Germany and many complai have been hurled against the German Coal Controller for having done this. Besides taking all these precautions we were unexpectedly favoured in the extraordinarily fine weather as well as the immunity from serious accidents and strikes of the railway men, or in the Ruhr. All of these possible difficulties we reviewed some weeks ago. I did not mention my meeting to my colleagues here in Berlin as I felt no good purpose would be served by it. Owing to the few number of working days in the months of November, December and January it will be a difficult task to furnish all the remaining six million tons. If we could count on reasonable weather there should be no difficulty especially as the output of the Ruhr coalfield is gradually rising and food conditions are improving in most parts of Germany. Yours sincerely, A. McFadyean, Esq., British Delegation, Reparation Commission, Hotel Astoria, PARIS." ],
