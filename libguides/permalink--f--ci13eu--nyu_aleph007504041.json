[...] Given the immense size of the subject site area and the research budget and time constraints imposed by the needs of the client for preparation of the referenced EIR and subsequent Specific Plan, an investigative approach was designed which would be reasonable and practical in striving to identify RECs, HRECs and PECs, thereby providing hazardous materials impacts data for the subject site in orde. [...] The objective of the site reconnaissance was to make observations of circumstances indicating the likelihood of identifying recognized environmental conditions and potential environmental concerns, including the potential for current or historical hazardous materials uses in connection with the subject site, and to document and verify the characteristics of the subject site neighborhoods related t. [...] The central portion of the Roeding area to the west of State Route 99 is primarily residential in nature, with the exception of the majority of properties along the north side of East Belmont Avenue. [...] It is Krazan’s experience that railroads may represent the potential for the historical use and storage of hazardous materials related to the maintenance of the track lines, as well as for purposes of servicing the operations of the current or former industries/business located adjacent to the railroad tracks." ],
