With each of these pillars playing a role, they also mutually interact to constitute an integrated framework that regulates the brokerage industry. Presenting practicable, extensive and cutting-edge research that encompasses various areas of the industry and detailed case studies from around the globe, the book provides a number of suggestions that have already been adopted and have begun to take effect. It also explores the frontiers of the real-estate brokerage industry - the incorporation of the internet, the blurred boundary between online and offline service where brokerages are moving online, client acquisition is via the internet, and benchmark companies are focusing more on their trading service capacity, each building their own controllable trading environment.\"-- Provided by publisher" ],
