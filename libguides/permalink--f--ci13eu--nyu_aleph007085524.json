My Lord, Though Dr.von Kahr's speech which formed the sub- ject of my telegram No.2 of the 11th June has given rise to continuous comment ever since it was delivered, nothing has transpired as to the ex-Premier's actual words. The press were not admitted to the meeting in question. Only the \"Bayerischer Kurier\" published a summary which is of some importance as the paper is an organ of the Bavarian people's Party. The main \"As tion of this short resume is as follows: \"As regards \"the war-responsibility question, the German people is \"guilty in so far that it could not maintain till the \"end of the war the same national pride and might as \"other nations. The young men of Germany will prepare \"a more favourable fate for their country if they will \"imitate the spirit of their forefathers, that spirit \"which saved Germany in 1813. The State must help in \"that good work: therefore it needs Power both at home \"and abroad. For that purpose it is necessary to pre- \"pare a modern army: the nation must see to it that it \"again becomes capable of defending itself: in spite of the His Majesty's Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Foreign Office London." ],
