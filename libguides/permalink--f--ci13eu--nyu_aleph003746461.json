The plays chronicle a continuous period in British history from the end of the 14th century to the aftermath of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Together, the plays comprise a story with recurring themes of power struggles, redemption, family conflict and betrayal.\"--IMDb.", "Richard II. After halting a duel between warring nobles Bolingbroke and Mowbray, Richard II banishes both men from his kingdom. Following the death of Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, Richard seizes his money and land to pay for wars against rebels in Ireland. Bolingbroke returns to claim his birthright and more.", "Henry IV, Pt 1. Prince Hal (Tom Hiddleston) defies his father, King Henry IV (Jeremy Irons) by spending his time at Mistress Quickly's (Julie Walters) tavern in the company of the dissolute Falstaff (Simon Russell Beale) and his companions. The King is threatened by a rebellion led by Hal's rival, Hotspur (Joe Armstrong), his father Northumberland (Alun Armstrong), and his uncle Worcester (David Hayman). During the Battle of Shrewsbury Hal faces Hotspur in mortal combat.", "Henry IV, Pt 2. Northumberland (Alun Armstrong) is told of the death of his son Hotspur in service of the King (Jeremy Irons). The Lord Chief Justice (Geoffrey Palmer) attempts to separate Falstaff (Simon Russell Beale) from the Prince Hal (Tom Hiddleston). The rebels continue to plot against the crown but their forces are outwitted. This brings comfort to the dying King, who is finally reconciled with his son. Falstaff rushes to Hal's coronation with the expectation of high office.", "Henry V. The newly crowned King of England, Henry V, (Tom Hiddleston) is persuaded by his courtiers including Exeter (Anton Lesser) and York (Paterson Joseph), that he also has a rightful claim to lands in France. The chorus (John Hurt) tells of England's preparations for war and Henry's army sails for France. After Exeter's diplomacy is rebuffed by the French King (Lambert Wilson) Henry lays siege to and captures the town of Harfleur. The French now take Henry's claims seriously and challenge the English army to battle at Agincourt." ],
