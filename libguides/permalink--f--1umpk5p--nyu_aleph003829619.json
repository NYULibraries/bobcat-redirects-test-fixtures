Widely used by both experienced and inexperienced writers, The Little, Brown Handbook works as both a comprehensive classroom text and an accessible reference guide. The twelfth edition of The Little, Brown Handbook provides all the resources that instructors have come to expect but with an added media component. Students who purchase the e-text or iPad version of this handbook will benefit from added instruction and practice through exercises, tutorials, podcasts, and sample papers. The Little, Brown Handbook builds on its best-selling features with five emphases: (1) media-rich eText and iPad versions, including video tutorials, podcasts, sample documents, exercise, and checklists;(2)academic writing, including a new introduction on joining the academic community, new coverage of genre, more on summary and academic integrity, and four new sample academic papers; (3) research writing, including new material on finding and evaluating Web sites, social-networking sites, blogs, wikis, and multimedia; (4) thorough and up-to-date documentation guidelines, including the most recent versions of MLA, APA, Chicago, and CSE styles with models of new media in each style and new annotated sample sources; (5) thewriting process, including new material on genre and strengthened discussions of the thesis and paragraphs\"--Pearson website." ],
