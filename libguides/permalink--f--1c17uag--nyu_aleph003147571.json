        "description" : [ "This study traces the history of the Provincetown Playhouse, located in Greenwich Village, New York City, from 1918 to 1922 and examines how the Provincetown Players, the company that began and used the playhouse in this period, contributed to American Theatre. By identifying and describing key personnel, selected productions, and critical responses to the work of the Players, the study attempts to show the Playhouse's artistic legacy to American Theatre. Key personnel include George Cram Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Floyd Dell, Jasper Deeter, Edna Kenton, Mary Eleanor Fitzgerald, James Light, Ida Rauh, Neith Boyce, Alfred Kreymborg and John Reed. Plays include Suppressed Desires, Trifles, Bound East for Cardiff, Aria da Capo, The Hairy Ape, Inheritors, Lima Beans, The Moon of the Caribbees, Tickless Time, Diff'rent, The Emperor Jones, Bernice, and The Verge. Critics of the time that reviewed the works included Heywood Broun, Alexander Woollcott, John Corbin, Ludwig Lewisohn and Percy Hammond.", "The study looks at the artistic and political climates surrounding the Players' organization and how these factors led to determining their mission of creating a theatre exclusively committed to the development and experimentation of plays written by American playwrights. The group began performing their plays in 1915 as a form of recreation in Provincetown, MA. Positive response led to creating a theatre out of an old fish house at the end of a wharf. In 1916 the group moved to Greenwich Village, performing in a parlor apartment they transformed at 139 Macdougal Street and then in 1918 creating a theater out of an old stable and bottling works at 133 Macdougal Street, calling both spaces the Playwright's Theatre. They produced the plays of Glaspell and the early plays of O'Neill. In 1920 they presented The Emperor Jones and the positive response was so overwhelming that the play moved to Broadway. This success, however, threatened the amateur spirit that had created an environment for experimentation and led to the group's demise. By their end in 1922, the company had produced ninety-seven plays by forty-six playwrights and ushered American theatre into the Modern era." ],
