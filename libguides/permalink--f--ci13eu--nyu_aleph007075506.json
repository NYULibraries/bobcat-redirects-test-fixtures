My Lord, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith translation of a document, published by the \"M端nchner Neueste Nachrichten\", on the subject of negotiations between the ex-Crown Prince of Bavaria and the Austrian Archduke Albrecht, which is stated to have been received by official circles in Berlin from what is alleged to be a reliable source. The paper holds the document up to ridicule as a concotion by credulous persons ignorant of Bavaria, or by hostile agents drawing on their imagination in order to earn their pay, and compares it to the famous \"entrenched camp of royalists\" on which the Prussia Commissioner Weismann reported some months ago. It will be observed that this document declares the Free Corps \"Oberland\" to be the main obstacle to the monarchist plans, whereas the Socialist reports, alluded to in my despatch No. 7 of the 12th instant, ascribed that role to Escherich. Simultaneously with the publication of the above His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Foreign Office London." ],
