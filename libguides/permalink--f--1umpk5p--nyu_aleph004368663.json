This guide is based on a study of referees' reports and letters from journal editors on reasons why papers written by non-native researchers are rejected due to problems with English usage. It draws on English-related errors from around 5000 papers written by non-native authors, 500 abstracts by PhD students, and over 1000 hours of teaching researchers how to write and present research papers. With easy-to-follow rules and tips, and with examples taken from published and unpublished papers, you will learn how to: prepare and structure a manuscript increase readability and reduce the number of mistakes you make in English by writing concisely, with no redundancy and no ambiguityplan and organize your paper, and structure each paragraph and each sentence so that the reader can easily follow the logical build-up towards various conclusionswrite a title and an abstract that will attract attention and be readdecide what to include in the various parts of the paper (Introduction, Methodology, Discussion etc) select from over 700 useful phrases highlight your claims and contributionavoid plagiarism and make it 100% clear whether you are referring to your own work or someone else'schoose the correct tenses and style (active or passive) Other books in the series: English for Presentations at International Conferences English for Academic Correspondence and Socializing English for Research: Usage, Style, and Grammar English for Academic Research: Grammar / Vocabulary / Writing Exercises Adrian Wallwork is the author of more than 20 ELT and EAP textbooks.
