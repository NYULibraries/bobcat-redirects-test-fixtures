Rather than prescribing restrictive templates or formulae, Sarah Burton and Jem Poster draw on their extensive experience as both successful writers and expert teachers to open up exciting possibilities. Intelligent and jargon-free, their guide thoughtfully navigates some of the most important and challenging aspects of creating fiction, such as the interplay of memory and imagination, the plotting of stories, the creation of convincing characters, the uses of description, and the pleasures and pitfalls of research. A storehouse of ideas and practical advice, from boosting self- motivation, to editing, to ultimately approaching agents and publishers, it will inspire confidence in developing authors.
