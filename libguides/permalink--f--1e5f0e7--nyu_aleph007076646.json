        "description" : [ "\"This first-of-its-kind book for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities (URM), women, and sexual and gender minorities in medicine offers the core knowledge and skills needed to achieve a well-planned, fulfilling career in academic medicine. The knowledge and skills provided by the esteemed co-authors, successful diverse pre-faculty, and junior and senior academicians, are complemented by their inspirational and motivational stories. Increasing diversity in the academic medicine workforce has been identified and embraced as a core value of institutional excellence at nearly all academic institutions and professional associations. Despite this established core value, certain groups such as Black/African-American, Latino/Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native-identified individuals, women, and sexual and gender minorities, are still present in lower proportions compared with the general population and lack inclusion. In 12 chapters and with a unique focus on a practical approach to increasing diversity and inclusion in academic medicine, this book demystifies the often-insular world of academic medicine. It comprehensively outlines career opportunities and associated responsibilities, how to transform academic-related work to scholarship, and offers a clear and transparent look into the academic appointment and promotion process. By focusing on the practical steps described in this handy book, students and residents can develop a strong foundation for an academic medicine career and succeed in becoming the next generation of diverse faculty and administrators\"--Publisher's description" ],
