We are frequently on a wild quest trying a little of everything without really knowing what to do or having a master plan to guide us. The key to success lies in understanding how clients buy -- the topic of our first book, How Clients Buy. Rainmakers are those among us who understand this well and demonstrate six skills that help facilitate the client's buying decision journey: 1) One: Strategy: Choose Your Niche and Whom You Wish To Serve 2) Two: Credibility: Demonstrate Your Expertise 3) Three: Relationships: Build Your Network 4) Four: Solutions: Understand Client Needs and Creating Solutions 5) Five: Performance: Do Great Work 6) Six: Stewardship: Care for Clients We can learn these skills and become more successful in our own practices\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
