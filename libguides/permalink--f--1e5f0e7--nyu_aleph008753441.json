        "description" : [ "This book increases undergraduate and graduate students' awareness of, interest in, and preparedness for academic health professions careers. It includes invaluable chapters that emphasize the importance of developing self-efficacy, knowledge, skills, and experiences not just for their resume but to build a foundation to strengthen students for the rest of their professional careers. The book provides the reader with basic information, tools, and a competitive edge through inspirational narratives from diverse graduate students and faculty, self-assessment exercises, and case-based discussion. These invaluable, authentic narratives will inspire, hearten, and encourage readers to pursue their health professional and academic careers confidently. Additionally, chapters outline the necessary tools for getting the most out of one's educational, research, service and leadership activities and optimize their competitiveness for graduate school and as pre-faculty. Unique, timely, and comprehensive, Health Professions and Academia provides undergraduate and graduate students with content to develop as competitive applicants to health-related graduate school and build a foundation from which they can establish successful careers in academia as future faculty, senior administrative leaders, and change agents." ],
