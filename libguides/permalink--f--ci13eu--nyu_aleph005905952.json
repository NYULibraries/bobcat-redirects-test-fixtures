Since 1988, he has directed the animation program at the Tisch School of the Arts' Kanbar Institute of Film and Television. He has also been a Guest Fellow at Yale University. Canemaker's interest in animation began in childhood, and it has moved him to write more than 100 articles on the subject, as well as several books, including the story of the making of Richard Williams' Raggedy Ann & Andy entitled: The Animated Raggedy Ann & Andy (1977). Canemaker's own films include:'The 40's' (1974), 'Bottom's Dream' (1983), 'The Hunger Project' (1987), animation sequences for 'The World According To Garp'(1981), 'You Don't Have To Die' (1988) which received an Academy Award, Confessions of a Stand-Up (1993), and Bridgehampton (1998). Canemaker began collecting the material that comprises this collection in the early 1970's, and eventually obtained a wealth of material about the history, technique,and cultural significance of animated films. Items include animation resources such as: documentary material, drawings, posters, storyboards, recorded interviews and lectures, personal research materials for his articles and books, and periodicals." ],
