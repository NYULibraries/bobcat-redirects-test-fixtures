Comprised of public altar installations, street processions, car caravans, poetry, dance, theater, face painting, crafts, culinary arts and other community rituals done to remember the deceased, a celebration that began as a decolonial act within the Chicano community gained mainstream popularity via public art, news media, Hollywood films, the Internet and commercial venues. This edition provides new in-depth coverage of: - the increase in Day of the Dead events across the US, incorporating media coverage and economic facets, - new discussion of recent political movements commemorated during Day of the Dead celebrations, including Black Lives Matter, climate activism and the #MeToo movement, - the greater media coverage and online presence of the celebration over the past 10 years, including blogs, websites, YouTube videos and other social media related to Day of the Dead face painting, costumes, altar making, and calavera crafts, - the incorporation of Día de los Muertos aesthetics and iconography in fashion, graphic design, video games, and movies such as the blockbuster 2017 Disney/Pixar film and the 2015 James Bond film Spectre; - the proliferation of and commercialization of the Day of the Dead through merchandise in commercial venues, including items such as foods and alcohol, home goods, clothing, holiday decorations and Halloween costumes at mainstream US stores such as Walmart, Costco, and Target, - testimonials from people discussing how Day of the Dead celebrations play an important role in their lives and the influence of the celebration on new and evolving attitudes in mainstream US society around openly discussing and preparing for death Examining the influence of the mass media, commercialization and globalization on the growth and transformation of Day of the Dead in the US, Regina Marchi combines ethnography, oral history and critical cultural analysis to provide insights into the power of cultural hybridity and invented traditions to communicate about identity, history and politics\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
