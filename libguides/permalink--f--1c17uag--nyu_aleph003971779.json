Manners matter to the English, yet the Daily Mail reported a study in 2008 \"claiming that bad manners were the biggest problem facing society.\" Part social history, part cultural critique, the book moves humorously from the ancient to the modern with pithy anecdotes and amusing factoids. In the medieval court of Henry II, \"One shouldn't attack an enemy while he is defecating, should avoid sharing secrets with one's wife, and ought to look towards the ceiling when belching.\" As the author notes, \"people have been talking about modern manners' since the 18th century, \" and the discussion continues. The tour of manners encompasses living conditions, language, social structures, innovations, and philosophy throughout centuries. This is not a book of etiquette instruction, but deconstruction." ],
