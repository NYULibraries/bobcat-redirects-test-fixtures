The correspondence offers details about day-to-day life on plantations, such as the conditions of harvests, credit and debt of the plantation, and British abolition of slavery. The collection also includes slave registers, but due to the fragile nature of the aged documents, not all slave registers could be digitized. Other documents include texts relating to the African slave trade, as well as to the connection between the American South and Cuba. Taken together, the documents in this collection paint a picture of the institution of slavery as it spanned centuries in the Caribbean." ],
