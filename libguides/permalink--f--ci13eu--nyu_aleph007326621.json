        "description" : [ "This book guides medical researchers through all stages of transforming their data and ideas into a published paper. Many researchers in medicine struggle to get their research written and published. One reason for this is that most medical researchers have not received much instruction in the subjects needed to write and publish scientific papers: research methodology, ethics, statistics, data visualization, writing, revising, and the practicalities of publishing. This book tackles all the major scientific issues that routinely lead to manuscripts getting rejected from the journals. The section \"Preparing\" covers the range of methodological, ethical, and practical aspects that researchers need to address before starting to write their paper. The section \"Analyzing\" reviews commonplace problems in the statistical analysis and presentation, and how to resolve those problems. The section \"Drafting\" describes what to write in the various parts of a paper (the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Abstract, etc.) The section \"Revising\" explains and illustrates how to improve the writing style of any manuscript. The section \"Publishing\" discusses how to navigate the peer review process and all other practical aspects of the publishing phase. The entire book draws on the author's decade of experience as an independent medical writer and research consultant. More importantly, the book is grounded in the existing scientific and scholarly literature, with extensive references and an annotated bibliography. After reading this book, medical researchers will know how to write better quality medical papers, so they can publish their work in better journals with less time and struggle." ],
