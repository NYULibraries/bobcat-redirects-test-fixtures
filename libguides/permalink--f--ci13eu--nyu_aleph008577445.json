[...] The key survey results are presented in Section 4. The report concludes with a discussion of the main findings and recommendations for further development of the ALUS program on PEI. [...] The objective of the pilot was to evaluate the effectiveness of an incentive based approach for the provision of environmental goods and services on private lands (essentially an ALUS program). [...] The success of the PEI EG&S pilot influenced the PEI Government to adopt the province-wide ALUS Program in 2008 (Souris and Area Branch of the PEI Wildlife Federation 2008). [...] The goals of the PEI ALUS program are to empower farmers in conservation and increase the supply of ecological goods and services across the province, and improve land management by: reducing soil erosion; improving water quality; improve and increase wildlife habitat; and reducing the impacts of climate change (Government of PEI 2012)." ],
