It is truly the cave dweller who still believes that math skills are the only requirement for success in the finance industry. Savvy professionals know that employers want and need employees with excellent relationship building, writing, and presentation skills. They also understand that the market demand for exceptional communication skills is going unmet. The Essential Guide to Business Communication for Finance Professionals asks its readers to adopt the \"communicate or die\" philosophy in their approach to their careers. Two business professors with years of experience in finance and communication offer advice and tips for approaching some of the most common business communication situations faced by today's finance professionals. Readers will walk away from this book with tools that can be applied immediately to manage their professional image and reputation. The advice and tips are enhanced through the use of real-world examples and quotes from professionals working in the finance field." ],
