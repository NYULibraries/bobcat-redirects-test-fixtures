        "description" : [ "This book aims to explore various aspects of the use of moving images in fashion retail and fashion apparel companies in-store or online. The use of moving images is growing in numbers and in relevance for consumers. Films can be used in various forms by fashion businesses in traditional media like cinema or TV and in modern forms like in social media or moving images in high street stores. The book provides a data-oriented analysis of the state-of-the-art with certain future outlooks. Additional areas of covering fashion in moving images, such as 'fashion company identity films or 'fashion and music videos are covered in order to get a more complete analysis from a consumer influenced perspective. Peter Bug is a professor of Fashion Marketing at Reutlingen University in Germany since 2000 and founding dean of the B. Sc. program International Fashion Retail since 2010. 2005 he lectured the Marketing and Marketing Research courses as full professor for one semester at the College of Business at Valparaiso University, IN, USA.
