        "description" : [ "\"From sweatshops to fur farming, from polluting chemicals to painful garments, the fashion industry is associated with activities which have had devastating effects on workers, consumers, and the natural world. This ground-breaking volume provides a framework for examining the ethical, social, and environmental dangers that arise as fashion products are designed, manufactured, distributed and sold within retail outlets, before being consumed and disposed of. Encompassing the cultural, psychological and physiological aspects of fashion, it offers a comprehensive exploration of the hazards of a global industry. Drawing together an international team of leading textile and apparel experts, The Dangers of Fashion presents original perspectives on a wide range of topics from piracy and counterfeiting to human trafficking; from the effects of globalization on local industry to the peer pressure that governs contemporary ideals of beauty. Rooted in research into industry practices, it discusses innovative solutions - both potential and existing - to fashion's dangers and moral dilemmas from the viewpoint of individuals, companies, societies, and the global community\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
