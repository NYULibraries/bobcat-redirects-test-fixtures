[...] The Commission made a motion to create the Healthcare Task Force at the request of the Committee for Quality Education. [...] Dr Gorski concluded with the explanation of how the Children’s Trust will continue to coordinate the high standard of health care given, conduct trainings for healthcare staff, conduct vision screenings with schools, and coordinate to provide mental health services. [...] Commission Libbin mentioned that the quickest study would be to ask the principals of the school. [...] Commission Libbin also recommended that we would need to find the funding gap by taking each of the eight schools and determining the healthcare needed and how much it costs." ],
