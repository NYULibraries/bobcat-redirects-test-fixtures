        "description" : [ "Over the past decades China gained the reputation of being the world's factory, focusing solely on manufacturing exports. This is about to change. The role of e-commerce is tremendously important in the context of the Chinese government's stated goal of relying less on exports to the recession-stricken West and focusing more on domestic consumption as a driver for further economic growth. This growth is largely underpinned by China's online population, which is currently the largest online population worldwide. This book is aimed at assisting Western entrepreneurs, SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) and investors to understand and ideally enter the Chinese e-merging market. It is designed to work as a step-by-step guide to the online marketplace environment in China. E-Commerce is an easy, fast, and cost-effective way of entering the Chinese market compared to more traditional ways of entry. Chinese e-commerce offers great opportunities for high profit gains to Western companies seeking to do business in China without the hurdle of heavy upfront investment. Entering the Chinese e-Merging Market provides a detailed overview of the Chinese online market and proposes different strategies available to foreign companies seeking to enter and remain competitive in this tremendously challenging and profitable market that is 21st century China. It provides practical advice, updated data, and relevant links for further reference that Western SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs, and business owners can use to establish their online presence in China." ],
