        "description" : [ "\"The acclaimed first volume in bell hooks' \"Love Song to the Nation.\" \"The word 'love' is most often defined as a noun, yet ... we would all love better if we used it as a verb,\" writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, bell hooks (renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist) skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question \"What is love?\" her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society's failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the \"100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.\" All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
