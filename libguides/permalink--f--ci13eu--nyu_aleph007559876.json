        "description" : [ "Submarine Base New London One of the issues raised at the hearing was the input from GAO (attached) on the SUBASE New London cost savings. [...] Rather, they ran a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of the increased costs identified during the Commission staff analysis on the 20-year NPV savings. [...] We have separately responded back to the Commission on 19 August with details of our review of the cost to close SUBASE New London submitted by the State of Connecticut. [...] We continue to believe the recommendation to close SUBASE New London is fully supported by the underlying data and analysis, consequently, the DON'Sr ecommendation should be sustained. [...] During Navy's formulation of our BRAC recommendations, we carefully evaluated our remaining'presence in the Northeast and determined that the creation of a Naval Air Facility (NAF) at Brunswick both achieves savings, by single siting the Maritime Patrol airframes for operational, maintenance and training efficiencies, while retaining a strategic presence in the Northeast. [...] The net effect of our recommendations is to increase the presence of the Navy at Newport as well as fully utilize its existing capacity. [...] Oceana Analvsis The discussions on Oceana have been intense and we appreciate the level of effort that the Commission is putting into the question of the proper siting of the Navy's East Coast Master Jet Base. [...] Having said that, we remain unconvinced that any alternative to the current operation at Oceana would provide a better option for the Navy for the next several decades and possibly beyond. [...] Finally, neither the Navy nor the Commission have analyzed the intangibles from this move such as moving Sailors from the Norfolk area where they have already established residency and where multiple tour opportunities abound and the disruption of relocating all East Coast TACAIR to a \"new\" location. [...] This is not a decision that should be made after a month of review with data that has not been subjected to the same level of analysis as that provided in the rest of the BRAC process." ],
