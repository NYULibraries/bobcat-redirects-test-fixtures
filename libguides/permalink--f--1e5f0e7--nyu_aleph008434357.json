This textbook has been recommended and developed for university courses in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.The authors offer students relevant research designs in business and management. They show how to overcome the common qualitative and quantitative methods divide. For this purpose, the textbook focuses on the scientific problem-solving process. It emphasizes the importance of an appropriate research design to produce intellectual contributions. The authors describe the most relevant research designs in business and management research. They assess each research design about its suitability to answer specific research questions. Also, the textbook covers academic writing and provides useful tips about the whole research process. It not only serves students as a resource to conduct their own research projects. Moreover, it is also a valuable reference throughout the whole academic career.
