Drawing from his experience as a research scholar, editor, review board member, mentor, and reviewer of many promotion and tenure cases, author Dean Shepherd offers strategies and other pieces of advice for navigating the obstacles that can prevent a successful scholarly career. This book provides an overview and roadmap to help entrepreneurship scholars achieve success, and stimulates thought and discussion for doctoral students and junior and senior faculty to consider as they look to develop the next generation in academia." ],
