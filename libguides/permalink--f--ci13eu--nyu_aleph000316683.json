The Persian Gulf War and the end of the cold war; the invention of the World Wide Web and the introduction of the Euro currency; the launching of the Hubble space telescope and \"Dolly,\" the cloned sheep, the repeal of apartheid in South Africa and nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan; ethnic violence in the Balkans and genocide in Rwanda these and other momentous events defined the last decade of the 20th century. Day by Day: The Nineties brings the past decade to life, listing the major events as they unfolded each day from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999. Providing researchers of all ages with a complete, accessible chronology documenting the major events of the period, this comprehensive two-volume set is an invaluable addition to any library. Day by Day: The Nineties offers a unique perspective of the social, economic, political, and cultural issues that defined the decade. Each of the 10 sections helps readers see what happened, how it developed, and what its repercussions were in the broadest terms while also providing focused, easy access to thematic information. The sections detail important events in world affairs; look at major happenings in regions throughout the world; bring out issues in U.S. politics, society, foreign policy and defense, as well as the economy and environment; and deal with milestones in science, technology, nature, culture, leisure, and lifestyle. A must for every school and public library, Day by Day: The Nineties provides a detailed account of the history-making events of the 1990s." ],
