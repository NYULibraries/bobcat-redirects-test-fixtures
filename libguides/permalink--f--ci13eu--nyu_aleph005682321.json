An evidence-based approach to management ensures that healthcare leaders ask the right questions, use the best evidence available, and make better decisions in carrying out their mission. Evidence-Based Management in Healthcare: Principles, Cases, and Perspectives explains what evidence-based management is, how it can guide decision making, and how it can lead the way to improved organizational performance. This updated edition provides a thorough overview and in-depth discussion of evidence-based management, a series of new and expanded case studies and examples, and interviews with notable figures in the field. Key topics include the following: the definition of and rationale for evidence-based management; the four main types of evidence; the six steps of implementation; acquiring the best available evidence; barriers to evidence-based management and how to overcome them; perspectives from stakeholders." ],
