Arguing that professional writing is ethical practice, which can have significant material impacts on the public domain, Anne Surma calls for an imaginative use of rhetoric. She shows how an ethical, imaginative and rhetorical approach can enable professionals, who often write from positions of relative power, to engage with their readers in ways that can benefit both parties and enhance democratic processes. Expanding the definition of professional writing to include public relations, political, Internet and email communication, and adopting a critical approach, she analyzes current public and professional texts and case study material to demonstrate how writers often miss the mark and how they might write more effectively and equitably." ],
