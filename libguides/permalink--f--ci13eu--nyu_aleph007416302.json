The documents also cover a visit to East Germany by a delegation from the American Friends Service Committee (A.F.S.C.), a Quaker organisation, at the invitation of the East German Peace Council; the delegation's meeting with Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader; and the possibility of the A.F.S.C. and the Peace Council working together to promote the \"relaxation and elimination of international tension\". Other documents comment on recent developments in the Evangelical Church in East Germany, with one branch publishing a thesis banning its officials from working in politics." ],
