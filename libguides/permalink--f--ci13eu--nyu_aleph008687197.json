        "description" : [ "\"For decades, sustainability books have pointed a path to more efficient, effective ways to save resources and money, but they just don't seem to be moving the needle. The problem is the sustainably minded haven't convinced skeptics that powerful economic incentives really exist. Using a unique, practical scorecard understandable to any executive in or outside of operations, this book, once and for all, makes the pragmatic argument for sustainable supply chains crystal clear. In the midst of \"green fatigue,\" many leaders have lost sight of the pure success any business can achieve by focusing on hidden supply costs and toxic inputs. The authors show operations and implementation-focused business leaders how to innovate their supply chains to introduce and scale sustainable solutions. Through repeatable, reliable processes that address operating model design and new key performance indicators to scaling, this book is a practical guide that leaders can rely on to make their existing systems more sustainable and profitable\"-- Provided by publisher.", "Using a rigorous, straightforward scorecard as a guide, this book shows business leaders and innovators how to create breakthrough sustainable products and processes that are good for the planet, human health, and profits. Natural resource inputs to business operations are getting scarcer and more expensive, while climate-change-related economic shocks pose a risk to seamless operations and, more importantly, threaten business continuity. How can organizations integrate sustainable design in their overarching operations and align it with profitability and corporate strategy? Based on Paul Anastas's foundational Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, the Sustainability Scorecard is the first scientifically rooted, data-driven methodology for creating inherently sustainable and profitable products and processes. By redesigning with sustainability as a key design element, firms open themselves to unexpected solutions, leapfrog innovations, and sources of value that simply don't occur when sustainability is leveraged purely as a risk-avoidance and compliance measure. Urvashi Bhatnagar and Anastas offer dozens of examples of how sustainable operations can yield benefits such as expanding market share, creating new service lines, and transforming supply-chain and sourcing models to drive the most consistent and highest long-term value. With this comprehensive framework, your firm will be able to identify truly innovative, inherently sustainable products as opposed to less bad products and processes that don't provide the exponential value that only breakthrough products can." ],
