The report covers the impact of the situations in Poland and Afghanistan on East Germany's relations with West Germany and the West; the decision of the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, to call off a meeting with the East German leader, Erich Honecker; and a speech by Honecker attacking West German foreign policy, and reiterating the East German policy of \"Abgrenzung\". Further commentary covers East Germany's decision to raise the minimum currency charges imposed on visitors arriving from the West; a decision to restrict travel between Poland and East Germany; and developments in the East German economy, which remained relatively stable. The report also covers the continuation of East Germany's fostering of relations with Third World countries; East German relations with the Soviet Union; and developments in Anglo-East German relations, with commercial and political relations remaining poor." ],
