Narrated by producer and Oscar®-winner Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Leila Conners, who first collaborated with DiCaprio eleven years ago on The 11th Hour, the feature-length documentary focuses on cutting-edge research behind today’s climate science – and the innovations aimed at reducing carbon in the atmosphere, which could pave the way for a reduction in the global temperature rises and a benefit to the planet’s life systems. With sweeping cinematography of a world worth saving, Ice on Fire crossing the globe, from Norway to Alaska, Iceland to Colorado, Switzerland to Costa Rica to Connecticut to highlight the firsthand accounts of people at the forefront of the climate crisis, with insights from scientists, farmers, innovators and others, finding that while the risks and urgency may be higher than ever today, there are also greater opportunities for innovative solutions, offering a realistic but hopeful perspective on a key global issue that demands our attention." ],
