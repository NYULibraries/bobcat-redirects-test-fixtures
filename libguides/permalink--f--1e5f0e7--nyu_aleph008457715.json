[...] In these poor states, the governments are unable to control economic life, the state activities are hardly visible in the rural areas, there is massive rural- urban drift and most people are in the informal sector of society, life is distressful and difficult and internal migration and immigration for greener pastures is the only aspiration for the young people. [...] 6 WESTERN DEVELOPMENT THEORIES AND MODELS AND HOW THEY HAVE FAILED The second half of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s witnessed various conceptions of development. [...] This resulted in the creation of the IMF and the World Bank with the notion that development is something positive and good and particularly geared towards the third world countries. [...] The current development impasse in Africa, the reduced international interest in Africa, and failure of the conventional development theories and models warrant “development” of the African culture and economies, requiring an intensification of inward looking development efforts within the continent." ],
