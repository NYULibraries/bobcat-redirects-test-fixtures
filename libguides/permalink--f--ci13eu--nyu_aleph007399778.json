Sponsored by The Society for Archaeological Sciences, it is an essential reference resource for those in the field of archaeology who want to understand the lives of those who have come before us, supported not only by science and technology, but also by theoretical approaches from the social sciences and the humanities. Comprised of over 480 entries contributed by scholars from all over the world and managed by 11 international and well recognized section editors, this comprehensive encyclopedia provides a broad overview of the scientific principles and techniques that allow for a more rigorous interpretation of archaeological data. It outlines how to study the characteristics and properties of materials, as well as instrumental techniques and relative methods currently applied in field and laboratory work. Key areas of content include Foundations of Archaeological Sciences, Field Methods in Archaeology, Analyses of Materials, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Conservation, Cultural Heritage, and Theoretical approaches to the study of material culture and our uses of archaeological sciences. As the 21st century promises to bring greater challenges to our capacity to live on the planet, archaeologists in collaboration with their scientific colleagues provide important evidence and solutions through their documentation of the diversity and complexity of human societies through time. The SAS Encyclopedia of Archaeological Sciences will therefore be a valuable reference work for students, researchers, and professionals in anthropology and archaeology as well as other disciplines.\"-- Provided by publisher" ],
