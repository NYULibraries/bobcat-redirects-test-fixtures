You'd study the game, learn its rules, practice, and make sure you had the right equipment to succeed--and you'd go into it knowing that winning would be tough. Landing the right job can be just as challenging: without planning, training, practice, and networking, you don't stand much of a chance to win a job that offers a bright future. In this guidebook to securing the job of your choice, you'll learn how to: determine what jobs are a good match for you; write cover letters that hiring managers notice; tailor a résumé to the position you're seeking to fill; and, make a great first impression on job interviews. If you're serious about winning the game, you need to prepare--and it starts with equipping yourself with the insights and strategies in Learning to Fish in the Twenty-First Century.\" -- Back cover." ],
