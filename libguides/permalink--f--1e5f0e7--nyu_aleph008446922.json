        "description" : [ "\"A charming look at felines photographed in a range of quirky and atmospheric shops across China, reflecting the country's unique culture and the good fortune these cats bring their owners. Cats are an adorable feature of daily life in China. Countless stores keep cats, and many store owners believe the enigmatic animals bring good luck to their establishments. Each cat is an essential part of the shops in which they live and hunt and reign as little emperors of their retail kingdoms. In this delightful and intriguing book, these frisky felines are photographed in their store environments with their owners. A one-of-a-kind publication, this book pairs captivating photographs with light-hearted haiku on shop life. When photographer Marcel Heijnen moved to China he was immediately drawn to these photogenic mousers. And while the cats are undoubtedly the furry celebrities of his photographs, each shot delivers an insightful glimpse into China's busy retail life. From dried sh and rice to paper sellers and tea merchants, the photographs' backgrounds present traditional Chinese retail culture in all its colorful glory.\"--Amazon.ca." ],
