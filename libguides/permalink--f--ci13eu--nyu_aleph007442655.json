Consequently, the more radical and prophetic thrust of his legacy of thought and action has been blunted. Seeking to resolve the public identity crisis about King, Ivory offers the provocative thesis that King is best understood as a creative theological thinker whose activist rhetoric and emancipatory praxis were thoroughly informed and undergirded by an understanding of God and God's will for history and humanity. Hence the prophetic focus and radical character of King's thought and action culminate in a \"theology of radical involvement,\" which gives rise to an \"ethic of community.\"" ],
