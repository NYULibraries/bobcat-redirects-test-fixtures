        "description" : [ "\"The publication of the James Herriot books led to an upsurge in interest in the veterinary profession among the public and inspired many to study veterinary medicine. However, the veterinary profession has changed markedly since those Herriot days, with many more opportunities for people entering the veterinary field--such as job prospects in bioscience research, government work, specialization in exotic animal medicine, animal welfare advisory work, international development work, and a whole host of other career options. The landscape of the veterinary curriculum has also broadened considerably, with topics like animal behavior, ethics, business management, client communication, veterinary public health, and clinical skills, alongside clinical veterinary medicine. Authored by a Royal Veterinary College instructor with extensive experience within the veterinary profession and with teaching new students, this book provides a thorough explanation of what prospective students can expect to study at veterinary school, and it discusses career options available to new graduates. Additionally, the book offers a useful overview of current issues in the wider veterinary profession, as well as an honest and thought-provoking discussion of what veterinary life is actually like. It will also be of benefit to qualified vets and agricultural students.\"--Page 4 of cover." ],
