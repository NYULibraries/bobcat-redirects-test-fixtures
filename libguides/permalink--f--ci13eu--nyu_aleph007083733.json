Rumbold to Lord Cuskendun.—(Received October 19.) (No. 775.) My Lord, Berlin, October 16, 1928. I HAVE the honour to enclose herewith a memorandum by the financial adviser to this Embassy recording a conversation with the president of the Reichsbank on the 12th instant. 2. Your Lordship will observe that Mr. Rowe—Dutton gained the definite impression that Herr Schacht had passed from the mood of hesitancy to a mood which did not appear to be one of sober reason, and which could even be described as one of dangerous optimism. Neither Mr. Rowe-Dutton nor I are in a position to say to what extent this change may have been induced by anything that M. Poincaré or Mr. Parker Gilbert may have said to the German Government. An appreciation of Herr Schacht's character was contained in Sir Ronald Lindsay's despatch No. 251 of the 27th March. 3. Herr Von Schubert is still absent from Berlin, and in such conversations as I have recently had with Germans, official and otherwise, I have merely observed that it is now fashionable to make light of the difficulties of floating German bonds on the American market. It appears to be at least clear that the discussions between the Reichskanzler and Herr Schacht have continued privately without the presence of experts. The whole subject is one which I am, of course, disinclined to discuss in detail, and which I have been careful to avoid introducing myself. I have, &c. HORACE RUMBOLD. Enclosure in No. 1. Note of Interview with the President of the Reichsbank, October 12, 1928. I CALLED on Dr. Schacht to—day and tendered my very hearty congratulations on his reappointment as president of the Reichsbank. He said he had been very pleased at the reappointment, not merely on personal grounds, but because he felt it was, to some extent at least, a recognition that the principles for which he had fought were recognised as sound. After a little preliminary conversation I opened a discussion on the forthcoming negotiations for a final settlement of reparations, and told Dr. Schacht that, while I could only speak to him personally, having received no definite instructions as to the view held by my Government, I had been oppressed by a feeling of anxiety when I regarded the difficulties which confronted us all and the somewhat scanty knowledge available to each of us of the other's point of view. Dr. Schacht said that, while he himself did not for a moment disregard the difficulties, he thought that politicians and diplomats were perhaps less good guides in these matters than practical business men. We should know by this time that when practical men got together the atmosphere became, day by day, more friendly and a settlement was bound to result. We had the precedent of the Dawes Committee, which had met in circumstances of complete gloom and had emerged into sunshine. He asked me on what particular points I felt pessimistic. I replied that my feeling was not so much pessimistic as uncertain. I could not talk details with him because there was as yet nothing definite to build upon. But. if I might give an example, the German papers were full of schemes for placing German Reparation Bonds upon the American and other markets. These schemes might please journalists, but I asked him whether he, as a practical man." ],
