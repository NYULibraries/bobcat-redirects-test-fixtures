        "description" : [ "Sue Short examines how fairy tale tropes have been reworked in contemporary film, identifying familiar themes in a range of genres - including rom coms, crime films and horror - and noting key similarities and differences between the source narratives and their offspring. How have familiar tales such as 'Cinderella', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Ali Baba' and 'Bluebeard' been redeployed in film? Why has the industry taken such a keen interest in reworking age-old stories? And are the 3D star vehicles currently being released necessarily the most interesting examples? Paying particular attention to less conspicuous adaptations in order to question exactly what constitutes a 'fairy tale film', Sue Short argues that some of the most significant revisions can be found where we least expect them. She also seeks to challenge negative evaluations of popular cinema - and its audiences - by illustrating some progressive ideas at work in frequently undervalued texts. The book is intended for anyone interested in contemporary cinema, gender and class representation in popular culture - and lovers of fairy tales everywhere" ],
