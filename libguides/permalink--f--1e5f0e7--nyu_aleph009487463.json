Chinese automakers are gradually establishing themselves as the new trendsetters in the automotive industry as they make technological advances in various fields, especially in electric vehicles. As more of them look overseas for opportunities, especially in the European market, it is time for the local players to better understand who they are up against and take steps to keep up with the rapid growth of their Far Eastern competitors. Based on Simon-Kuchers project experience, this book shows what is going on behind the Great Wall, informs readers about the latest technological trends and advances in China, and offers suggestions on what Chinese newcomers should bring with them when they come to town. Sharing valuable insights for all readers with an interest in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, this book will be particularly relevant for managers and decision-makers at Western OEMs, suppliers, and other relevant players in the automotive industry." ],
