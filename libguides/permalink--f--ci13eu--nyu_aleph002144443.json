        "description" : [ "Program one, The Body Speaks, begins with an interview of the late Polish actor/dancer Ryszard Cieslak by Margaret Croyden. The interview is followed by a performance in two parts by Cieslak and two Danish students. These performances consist of dance-like \"exercises\" for actors intended to demonstrate how body movement can be as useful and expressive dramatically as any other component of the actor's craft. The \"exercises,\" performed without music, are in two parts entitled \"The Plastiques\" and \"The Corporals,\" each utilizing different parts of the body. Cieslak was the star of the Polish Laboratory Theatre, directed by Jerzy Grotowski. Program two, Why Alice? presents a complete performance of a piece of \"performance theater\" based on the writings of Lewis Carroll, and directed by André Gregory. The performance is interspersed with segments of an interview of director Gregory by John Lahr. They discuss, among other things, the difficulties inherent in the dramatic presentation of a literary classic such as Alice in Wonderland. The actors are members of the New York University School of the Arts Theatre Company, the Manhattan Project, and are presented by Lyn Austin and Oliver Smith in association with Extension, Inc." ],
