Discussing key characteristics of luxury such as craftsmanship and preservation of artisan skills, product quality and durability, and limited quantities of luxury goods, the authors argue that luxury brands are inherently sustainable from economic, social and environmental perspectives. Sustainable Luxury Brands gives a comprehensive overview of luxury to demonstrate this claim, also focusing on sustainable luxury from a consumer perspective. The authors furthermore compare and contrast sustainability within the mass market to the luxury sector, and present insights into current and upcoming topics in luxury research." ],
