        "description" : [ "This book is a toolkit for young academic physicians and researchers to learn the behaviors and steps necessary for achieving success in academia. Written by a successful academic clinician, the book shares his personal experience alongside his years of successfully teaching and mentoring young medical professionals. The authors main aim is to provide insightful tips and tricks that will hopefully not only motivate the reader to persevere through difficult competitive periods in his or her life, but also provide him or her with a strategic behavioral plan that will solidify his or her work habits and ensure success. This book begins with a chapter about why knowledge and learning should be communicated, and then expands on that mindset through both general behavioral changes and those specific to the life of an academic researcher, like writing articles. Some key topics covered in the text include: The importance of sharing knowledge and the associated public and personal benefits Taking one step at a time and planning out work into small, attainable goals Developing a growth mindset The importance of collaboration and successful mentors This is an ideal guide for young academic physicians and researchers working in universities, academic health sciences centers, and research institutes hoping to learn how to achieve success in academia. It could also prove useful to more established academics that need a refresher or a new perspective on their work and goals." ],
