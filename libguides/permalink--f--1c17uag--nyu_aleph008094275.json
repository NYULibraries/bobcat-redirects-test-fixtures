        "description" : [ "\"Writing well is not the result of luck or innate talent. Writing is a skill you can learn, just as you learned nursing skills such as venipuncture and suctioning. However, nurses often find it challenging to write. After all, as Margaret McClure says in Words of Wisdom From Pivotal Nurse Leaders, \"One of nursing's biggest handicaps is that we are in a field where your basic practice requires that you never write in complete sentences\" (Houser & Player, 2008, p. 70). This book is designed to help you bridge the gap between incomplete sentences and a published manuscript. The book's contributors include the best and the brightest from publishing today. Many of the contributors have experience as editors of nursing journals, where their role is to decide which articles to accept for publication. These decision-makers share important insights that will enhance the likelihood your manuscript is accepted for publication. You also can draw a wealth of knowledge from the many years of writing experience that the contributors bring to this book. These authors have a long history of success in having their work published; the important tips they share will set you on track to seeing your work in print or online\"-- Provided by publisher" ],
