Subjects covered in the file include a visit to East Germany by a delegation from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, led by János Péter, the Hungarian foreign minister. The communiqué published at the end of the visit stated that the two countries had talked about the preservation of European Security, the \"widening aggressive tendencies of the United States\", the \"increased militarist and revanchist aspirations\" of West Germany, and the importance of preventing West German access to nuclear weapons. Analysis from the British Military Government in West Berlin notes that very little development had taken place in relations between the two countries over the preceding year; and that the status of Berlin had not been mentioned in the communiqué, which, along with other phraseology in the document, suggested a worsening of relations between the two countries." ],
