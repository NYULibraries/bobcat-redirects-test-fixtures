Drawing on wisdom from dozens of experienced authors, professors, students, and other writing professionals, this book offers pragmatic and systematic advice on the everyday professional practices that make up a writer's life. In ten chapters, Franklin covers the full arc of a writer's professional development, from setting goals and establishing a routine, to mastering writing groups and workshops, earning a mentor, and becoming a literary citizen. He explores strategies for attending conferences, finishing projects, submitting work, and maintaining a life-long writing habit, and he examines the potential benefits of a formal creative writing education, including a close look at how creative writing students can leverage their liberal arts training into a wide range of careers. Informative and personal, The Writer's Hustle is an ideal companion for university students, recent graduates, and independent enthusiasts--anyone looking to cultivate the creativity, discipline, humility, and grit that every writer needs to flourish." ],
