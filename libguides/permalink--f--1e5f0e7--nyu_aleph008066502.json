Lee Crutchley, author of How to Be Happy (Or At Least Less Sad), skips the platitudes, positive affirmations, and guarantees of success; he'll never ever tell you to just Do What You Love. Instead, Crutchley discusses the things nobody else is talking about-that, frankly, your work sucks (but that's ok because everyone else's does too), that making bad art is worth it, and so much more. In a world desperate for a glimpse of authenticity, Nobody Knows What They're Doing is a breath of fresh air that reveals the truths hiding between the lines of Instagram-friendly aphorisms and behind the words of the most inspirational TED talks. An honest look at the reality of creativity and the joy and difficulty of crafting good (and bad) art, this book belongs in the hands of every exhausted creative, every starry-eyed dreamer, and every artist who is trying to make their way in the world-and keep a roof over their head while they do it\"-- Provided by publisher." ],
