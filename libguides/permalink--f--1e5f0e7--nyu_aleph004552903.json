Until the early 1990s, its retail sector remained largely closed to overseas retailers. Since then, this sector has gradually opened to foreign involvement, a process boosted by China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. China now constitutes an increasingly significant market for overseas retailers. Based upon extensive first hand comparative research conducted at multinational retailers from the United Kingdom and Japan, this book investigates the transfer of parent country organizational practices by these retailers to their Chinese subsidiaries.
