        "description" : [ "Pasadena Department of Transportation - Public Transportation Services Overview The City of Pasadena provides essential local public transportation services to the City of Pasadena and the surrounding area, connecting people to the community and the regional transit network. [...] The dispenser has a plug that goes into the bus to provide energy to charge the battery, and the plug connects to the dispenser via a hose. [...] The dispenser is then connected to the charging cabinet, which contains the power electronics and communications equipment used to control charging with the bus and to communicate with the charging provider’s network. [...] There are two types of pantograph chargers: a top-down charger, in which the pantograph lowers itself down to the bus to initiate charging, and a bottom-up charger, in which the pantograph is mounted on the bus and raises itself to the charger to begin charging. [...] However, if the buses were to run low on charge during the day, they would have the option to charge at a public charging station during a break in service to refill the battery and extend the range of the bus." ],
